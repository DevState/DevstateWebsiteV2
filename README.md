Finest Html5 Canvas and WebGL Workshops.

DevState is a collaboration by Frank Reitberger http://www.dasprinzip.com/ , Sakri Rosenstrom http://www.sakri.net and Nicolas Barradeau http://www.barradeau.com/

We have cherry picked a number of key programming techniques which have been essential to us two during our combined 45 years of programming. We have applied these concepts in a curated set of html5 Canvas and WebGL workshops.

The purpose of this repository is to provide the source code of our course material and any demos found on our website.
